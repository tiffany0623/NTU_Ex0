```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      results = 'markup',
                      fig.width = 4,
                      fig.height = 3,
                      fig.align = 'center',
                      message = F,
                      warning = F)
```

## Package
```{r}
# package
library(dplyr)

# set seed
set.seed(0623)
```

## 1.Successfully Install R and RStudio.  
```{r}
# screenshot: the proof of install R and Rstudio
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tiffany/Desktop/NTU_Exercise0/Install R and RStudio.png")
```

## 2.Set working directory to a certain folder on your computer.
```{r}
getwd()
```

## 3.Put the dataset I send you in the working directory and import the data into RStudio.
```{r}
# screenshot: the proof of import dataset
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tiffany/Desktop/NTU_Exercise0/Import Dataset.png")
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tiffany/Desktop/NTU_Exercise0/Dataset.png")
```

```{r}
# Read (and import) the full example data set into R using read.csv()
example <- read.csv(file = 'Data_example.csv')
example

# view the data example in R
View(example)
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tiffany/Desktop/NTU_Exercise0/View Example.png")
```

## 4.Calculate Mean, Variance, SD, Max, Min, Median of the variable Rating
```{r}
# Summary
example %>%
  summarize(Mean = mean(Rating), 
            Variance = var(Rating),
            SD = sd(Rating),
            Max = max(Rating),
            Min = min(Rating),
            Median = median(Rating))
```

## 5.For the first 10 values of Rating, do logarithm, exponential, divide the vector by a number, multiplication by a number.  
```{r}
# x represents a vector for the first 10 values of Rating
# subtract the first 10 values of Rating
x <- example$Rating %>% 
  head(10)

# logarithm
log_x <- log(x)
log_x
# exponential
exp_x <- exp(x)
exp_x
# divide the vector by a number (2)
division_x <- x/2
division_x
# multiplication by a number (5)
multiply_x <- x*5
multiply_x
```

## 6.Vector, matrix, entries in a matrix, multiplication of vectors, matrices.  
```{r}
# define three 4*1 vectors
v1=c(1,2,3,4) 
v2=c(6,2,8,4) 
v3=c(9,3,6,1)

# add the number 3 to v1
v1+3
# add v1 to v2
v1+v2
# product of v1 and v2
v1*v2
# create a matrix, using v1,v2,v3 as the columns 
cnames <- c("v1", "v2","v3")
matrix1 <- matrix(c(v1,v2,v3), nrow=4, ncol=3)
colnames(matrix1) = cnames
matrix1
# print the element in row 1 and columns 1
matrix1[1,1]
# print the element in row 1 and columns 3
matrix1[1,3]
# print the first two elements in row 1 
matrix1[1,1:2]
# print the first three elements in row 1 
matrix1[1,1:3]
# print the elements in the first row
matrix1[1,]
# print the elements in the first column
matrix1[,1]
```
## 7. Make a plot using the variable Rating. Try to make the plot better looking and more informative.
```{r}
# make a plot by Rating
plot(example$Rating, type = "b", pch = 20, col = "blue", 
     main = "Plot of Rating in Example Data",
     xlab = "Number (No.)", ylab = "The Value of Rating")
text(example$Rating, labels=example$Rating, cex=0.7, pos=3, col="red")
legend("topright", "Each Rating value (100 in total)", pch=20, col="blue")

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/tiffany/Desktop/NTU_Exercise0/Plot of Rating.png")
```


## 8. Linear regression and interpret the results. 


```{r}
# use BoxOffice as dependent variable; Budget and Rating as independent variables to run the regression.
lr_example <- lm(BoxOffice ~ Budget + Rating, data = example)
```

```{r}
# show the regression results
summary(lr_example)
```

Interpretation:

From the summary above, we can find that this linear regression model fits the data NOT well. 

The p-value for Intercept is around 0.0525 with the one period signify (.) and p-value for Rating is around 0.4469 with a blank, which means the coefficients are not very significant. Thus, the model fit not well. However, the p-value for Budget is around 5.66e-08 with the three asterisks signify (***), which means this coefficient is very significant. 

Besides, the Multiple R-squared value is about 0.2649 and Adjusted R-square value is about 0.2497, which are small. It means 25 percentage of the variation within our dependent variable that all predictors are explaining. Thus, the model is not fitting the data very well.

## 9. Install a package: stargazer
```{r}
# install.packages('stargazer') 
```

## 10. Use functions from this package to output the regression results
```{r}
library(stargazer)

# output the regression results
stargazer(lr_example, type = "text", title = "Linear regression model of data example")

```
